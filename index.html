        <i>I didn't like the idea of copying the same header and footer to every page. 
        Yes, there is only 3 pages here and there is not hard to modify this 3 documents if I want to change something. 
        But this page will maybe be developed to alot of more links in the header, and if I can change one document instead of 20 this solution is much easier.
